# **Robotics Learning Resources** 

***&emsp;&emsp;Robotics** is a branch of engineering and science that includes **electronics engineering, mechanical engineering and computer science**. This branch deals with the design, construction, use to control robots, sensory feedback and information processing.

&emsp;&emsp;There was an author named **Issac Asimov**, he said that he was the first person to give robotics name in a short story composed in 1940’s. In that story, Issac suggested three principles about how to guide these types of robotic machines. Later on, these three principles were given the name of **Issac’s three laws of Robotics**.<br>
These three laws state that:*
 >  *   **Robots will never harm human beings.**
 >  *   **Robots will follow instructions given by humans with breaking law one.**
 >  *   **Robots will protect themselves without breaking other rules.**

## **Robotic Operating System(ROS)**

***&emsp;&emsp;ROS (Robot Operating System)** provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license.*
